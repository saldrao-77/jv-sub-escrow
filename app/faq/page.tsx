              <AccordionContent className="text-white/70 pb-4">
                JobVault provides a secure escrow account where your customers can deposit funds for materials based on
                your quote. Instead of waiting for a deposit directly, you send a quote with an escrow link. Once
                funded, you can access the money through direct transfer or a JobVault card. This gives you immediate
                cash flow while giving your customer peace of mind that funds will be used for their project.

              <AccordionContent className="text-white/70 pb-4">
                Most contractors are up and running within 24 hours. You can create your account, set up your first
                escrow request, and start receiving funds immediately. Our onboarding team will guide you through the
                setup process, including configuring your payment preferences and receipt tracking options.

              <AccordionContent className="text-white/70 pb-4">
                No. You maintain complete control over your pricing and markup. Customers only see the total amount you
                quote for materials. You set your prices upfront in your quote, and JobVault simply secures those funds
                in escrow. Your business model and margins remain private, just as they would with traditional payment
                methods.

              <AccordionContent className="text-white/70 pb-4">
                After making a purchase, simply snap a photo of the receipt and text it to our system or upload it
                through the app. Our system automatically matches receipts to transactions, creating a clean digital
                record. This eliminates the need to keep paper receipts and provides documentation if questions arise
                later. The receipt details remain private to youâ€”customers only see that a verified purchase was made.

                Yes, JobVault offers mobile apps for both iOS and Android devices. You can send quotes with escrow
                links, manage funds, track expenses, and submit receipts directly through the app. The mobile experience
                is designed for contractors on the go, allowing you to manage your cash flow from the job site or supply
                store.

              <AccordionContent className="text-white/70 pb-4">
                Yes, JobVault gives you control over spending. You can set specific spending limits for each card based
                on your material quotes. You can also restrict cards to specific vendors or merchant categories,
                ensuring funds are only used for approved materials. This flexibility allows you to manage your cash
                flow effectively while maintaining transparency with your customers.
